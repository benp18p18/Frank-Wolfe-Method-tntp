# Frank-Wolfe-Method-tntp

Steps to Run:<br>
1) Download the zip file <br>
2) Exact <br>
3) In the commandline, cd to the fold <br>
5) type "make" into the commandline <br>
6) to run ./F_W.exe <br>
7) Chose either c for a custom set of a network and trips or chose d for the default set of the Chicago Regional<br>
<br>
NOTE:<br>
There are some data sets in the folder itself and others can be used either by:<br>
  -Placing the datasets in the folders (The preffered method)<br>
  -Using there paths as there location<br>
 <br>
 The URL from where I got my datasets from: https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks.git
 <br>
 <br>
 Additionally it should be noted that some of the datasets in there default<br>
 might not be formatted correctly. To do so, remove the ~comment lines but leave ~header line. <br>
<br>
8) input the Miles cost which is a impedence cost of minute/mile. Each Dataset has a different Miles cost<br>
<br>
For the datasets in the folder already:<br>
(Chicago Regional) Mile Costs = 0.25<br>
(Chicago Sketch) Mile Costs = 0.04<br>
(Sioux Falls) Mile Costs = 0<br>
<br>
9) Lastly chose the number of integrations of the Frank-Wolfe method to do.<br>
<br>
Let me know if there are any issues<br>
